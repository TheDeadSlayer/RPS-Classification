# Classification of Rock-Paper-Scissors Gestures
This project uses computer vision and feature engineering to classify hand gestures into rock, paper, or scissors, based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors Images dataset from Kaggle. Custom preprocessing techniques, including edge and contour detection, are combined with machine learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, achieving up to 93% accuracy. The project also features an interactive RPS game that predicts gestures and determines winners.

# Features:
- Image preprocessing: greyscale conversion, resizing, and background removal.
- Feature engineering: edge detection, contour extraction, and corner detection.
- Dataset: [Rock-Paper-Scissors Images from Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors)
- Classifier comparison: Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting.
- Interactive gameplay module for gesture prediction and game simulation.
