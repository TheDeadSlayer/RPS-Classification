# Classification of Rock-Paper-Scissors Gestures
This project implements a Python-based solution for classifying images of hand gestures into rock, paper, or scissors. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset of 2188 images, the project features custom image preprocessing and manual feature extraction techniques. The classification employs machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to achieve up to 93% accuracy. A unique feature of the project is the interactive RPS game where the system predicts gestures and determines the winner. Future work could explore deep learning approaches for enhanced performance.

# Features:
- Custom preprocessing: greyscale conversion, resizing, and background removal.
- Feature engineering: edge detection, corner detection, and contour extraction.
- Comparative model evaluation with results for Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
- Interactive gameplay module for Rock-Paper-Scissors.
